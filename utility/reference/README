# Information

This folder contains the reference information that comes with the following census information:

Census Profile, 2021 - Canada, Provinces, Territories, Census Divisions, Census Subdivisions and Dissemination Areas
Catalogue number: 98-401-X2021006	Release date: 2022-12-15

The census information itself is NOT stored in this repo due to its large size. Developers will have to download the data themselves.
You can download the census information from [here](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/dp-pd/prof/details/download-telecharger.cfm?Lang=E&SearchText=toronto&DGUIDlist=2021A00053520005&GENDERlist=1&STATISTIClist=1&HEADERlist=0)

**DO NOT COMMIT THE DATA ITSELF TO THIS REPOSITORY OTHERWISE YOU WILL MAKE MAC VERY VERY MAD.**

## Importing Census Data

If you want to have your census data stored in your local copy of the repository, move your data to in `utility/.data`. Git is configured to automatically ignore the contents of that folder, so you won't need to worry about accidentally committing the data.

The helper bash scripts also assume that the data is in `utility/.data` - so this will prevent you from having to re-type CLI args every time.

**NOTES:** You do not need to import the `98-401-X2021006_English_meta.txt` or `README_meta.txt` files. They are just documentation files and can be found in this folder.
